How to FTP with Ant, a primer specifically using Terminal in OSX.
By: Brian Connatser

1. Download the latest build of Ant: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
2. Set the $ANT_PATH variable: Set this to your install of Ant/lib - This makes the JAR files available to all Ant users and builds.
	- 	echo $ANT_HOME
	-	export ANT_HOME=[PATH TO YOUR INSTALL/lib]
3. Make sure you have the latest Java JDK: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
4. Make sure the $JAVA_PATH is set: 
	- 	echo $JAVA_HOME	
	-	export JAVA_HOME=[PATH TO YOUR JDK INSTALL]
5. Add the Ant build path the $PATH variable: 
	-	export PATH=[PATH TO YOUR ANT INSTALL:$PATH] - the :$PATH appends your current path variable. 
6. Test your Ant install by going to an empty directory and typing: ant
	-	You should get something in return like: 
			Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
			Build failed
			- This is ok, we haven't created the build.xml file yet. But, this lets us know that ant is installed correctly
			- and looking for a build.xml file.
7. Ant does not come with the jars needed to ftp by default, so grab:
	-	commons-net...jar: http://commons.apache.org/net/download_net.cgi (The latest at the time of this demo is commons-net-2.0.zip)
	- 	jakarta-oro...jar: http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_oro.cgi (Grab the Binary zip: 2.0.8.zip)
	-	unzip both and place them in your ant install /lib directory. This will give all users of the system access to the jars.
8. Create your build.xml and build.properties files. 
9. Go to the directory containing your build files and run "ant".
10. If all goes well your ftp will process.

Sample build.xml:

<project name="ftp_demo" default="deploy_all">

	<property file="build.properties" />
	
	<!--
		The taskdef needs to be set for Ant to know to use the ftp classes. 
		Notice I am pointing to my $ANT_HOME path and directly to the commons-net-ftp-2.0.jar
		*If using Eclipse, you don't need this taskdef, simple add the jar to the ANT_HOME class path.
	-->
	<taskdef name="ftp" classname="org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.net.FTP">
	  <classpath>
	    <pathelement location="${ANT_HOME}\lib\commons-net-ftp-2.0.jar"/>
	  </classpath>
	</taskdef>
	
	<target name="init" description="Begin main process for file transfer" depends="begin_download">
		<echo message="The file transfer has completed." />
	</target>

	
	<target name="begin_download" description="Perform file transfer.">
		<echo message="The files are in the process of downloading." />
		<ftp action="get" server="${SERVER_ADDRESS}" userid="${USER_ID}" password="${PASSWORD}" remotedir="${REMOTE_DIRECTORY}">
			<fileset dir="${LOCAL_DIRECTORY}"/>
		</ftp>
		<echo message="The files have been downloaded." />
	</target>
		
</project>



Sample build.properties:

#Server information
SERVER_ADDRESS=
USER_ID=
PASSWORD=
REMOTE_DIRECTORY=
LOCAL_DIRECTORY=
